#  Operations Research & Financial Engineering 

## [Welcome ](/welcome)

Located in the beautiful Sherrerd Hall, the department of Operations Research & Financial Engineering (ORFE) is one of the six departments of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  It was founded in 1999 following the footsteps of great Princeton scientists in statistics (Tukey, Wilks), in probability (Feller, Hunt), in optimization (Kuhn, Tucker), in convex analysis (Gomory, Rockafellar) and in game theory (Nash, Morgenstern, von Neumann). Our research and teaching are centered around these topics making our courses among the most popular ones in Princeton.  

Graduates of our programs are consistently recognized for their excellence and are highly sought after across academia, industry, and government sectors. The department currently comprises 18 faculty members, 62 graduate students, and approximately 250 undergraduate concentrators.

Thank you for visiting our site which provides detailed information on our activities.
