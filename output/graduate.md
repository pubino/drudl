#  Graduate Program 

## Ph.D.

The Ph.D. is formulated to prepare students for research and teaching. The aim of the program is to provide a strong disciplinary background in one of the core areas of research in the department. The emphasis is on the theoretical foundations, mathematical models, and computational issues in practical problem solving. Current teaching and research activities include probability and stochastic processes, stochastic analysis, mathematical statistics, linear and nonlinear optimization, stochastic optimization, convex analysis, stochastic networks and queueing theory, mathematical and computational finance, and financial econometrics. Application areas of current interest to faculty include finance, energy, health, bioinformatics, and engineering problems. To learn more about the research interests of individual faculty members, please visit the [Research](/research) page.

The departmental faculty are affiliated with a number of interdisciplinary programs and centers, including the [Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics](http://www.pacm.princeton.edu/), the [Bendheim Center for Finance](https://www.princeton.edu/bcf/), the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://www.princeton.edu/acee/), the [Princeton Environmental Institute](http://www.princeton.edu/pei/), and the [Center for Statistics and Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/). Students may combine their departmental work with courses and research opportunities offered by such programs and centers and also by other departments including Computer Science, Economics, and Mathematics. About half of PhD recipients in Operations Research & Financial Engineering accept positions in academia. See [this list of first positions of our graduating PhD students](/academics/phd/job-placement).

## Curriculum

In the first year of the Ph.D. program, students enroll in the 6 departmental core courses in probability, statistics, and optimization in consultation with the Department's Director of Graduate Studies, to be followed by a qualifying exam at the end of the summer. In addition, at least two advanced courses and two semesters of directed research are completed under the direction of a faculty adviser in the student's area of interest by the end of the second year in preparation for the general examination. The general examination is normally taken in the Spring of the second year of study. Usually, beyond the general examination, two to three years are needed for the completion of a suitable dissertation. Upon completion of theses studies and acceptance of the dissertation by the department, the candidate is admitted to the final public oral examination.

A comprehensive guide to the ORFE Ph.D. program can be found in the [Graduate Student Handbook](/graduate/handbook) and in the [Graduate School Catalog](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/academics/fields-study/operations-research-and-financial-engineering).

## Research Seminars

The weekly departmental colloquium series brings distinguished researchers to the department to present their latest work. In addition, informal research seminars are organized in order to exchange information and to discuss ideas arising from the research work in progress. Students, research staff, visiting scholars, and faculty members participate in these seminars.

## Application

A bachelor's degree in engineering, sciences, or mathematics is normally required for admission to the graduate program. A strong mathematical background is expected for admission. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) results will be optional (not required) for Fall 2025. Graduate students must demonstrate a level of oral proficiency in the English language sufficient to participate successfully in the various activities that comprise a graduate education, including classwork, research, research presentations, group meetings, project teamwork, and teaching undergraduates. 

The following applicants are not required to submit English language test scores. **All other applicants must submit valid TOEFL, IELTS or DET scores** :

  * Applicants whose primary language is English. Primary language is defined as the language that someone communicates in most frequently and in most situations when speaking, reading, and writing
  * Applicants whose undergraduate instruction is entirely in English as certified by the institution and for whom the degree will be awarded prior to anticipated enrollment at Princeton
  * Applicants whose graduate study was on a full-time basis for at least **two** **academic years** where instruction is entirely in English as certified by the institution.



For more information see [the Graduate School's information on English Language Tests](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/admission-onboarding/prepare/required-tests#ELP).

You may request an application fee waiver within the application.

## Financial Support

The department aims to support all doctoral students requesting aid through a combination of fellowships and assistantships. All first-year Ph.D. candidates are supported by full-time fellowships, allowing students to focus on courses and providing flexibility in the choice of a research adviser. From the second year onward, students are supported by a combination of teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Continuation of support is recommended on the basis of satisfactory progress.

Further [details on financial support](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/financial-support) are provided by the Graduate School.

## Research Groups

The Department features several research groups that facilitate collaborations between students and faculty and provide a variety of resources for research and teaching. These include the following:

Financial Engineering. This group is home to computers, software, and financial data feeds needed for teaching and research in financial engineering. It is a focal point for graduate students in the Ph.D. program in financial engineering and M.Fin. It also serves as a gateway to collaborative research projects with financial institutions.

The [Statistics](/statlab) and [Financial Econometrics](/finmetricslab) labs emphasize statistical methods in financial econometrics and risk management, computational biology, biostatistics, high-dimensional statistical learning, data-analytic modeling, longitudinal and functional data analysis, nonlinear time series, wavelets and their applications, among others. The group's primary research focuses on developing and justifying statistical methods that are used to solve problems from the frontiers of scientific research.

[Transportation Center](http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/). The center conducts research on information and decision engineering technologies and how these technologies can be used to improve transportation-related decision making.

## Master in Finance

The department is a major participant in the Master in Finance (M.Fin) degree program offered through the Bendheim Center for Finance. Further information is available via the [Bendheim Center for Finance](https://bcf.princeton.edu/academic-programs/master-in-finance/).
