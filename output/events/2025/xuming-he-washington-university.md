Some Recent Developments in Expected Shortfall Regression

## Details

Event Description

**Abstract** : Expected shortfall, measuring the average outcome (e.g., portfolio loss) above a given quantile of its probability distribution, is a common financial risk measure. The same measure can be used to characterize treatment effects in the tail of an outcome distribution, with applications ranging from policy evaluation in economics and public health to biomedical investigations. Expected shortfall regression is a natural approach of modeling covariate-adjusted expected shortfalls. Because the expected shortfall cannot be written as a solution of an expected loss function at the population level, computational as well as statistical challenges around expected shortfall regression have led to stimulating research. We discuss some recent developments in this area, with a focus on a new optimization-based semiparametric approach to estimation of conditional expected shortfall that adapts well to data heterogeneity with minimal model assumptions.

**Bio** : [Xuming He](https://sds.wustl.edu/people/xuming-he) is the Kotzubei-Beckmann Distinguished Professor and Inaugural Chair of Statistics and Data Science at the Washington University in St. Louis. He currently serves as President (2023–2025) of the International Statistical Institute, and Joint Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS-B) .  His research interests include theory and methodology in robust statistics, semiparametric models, quantile regression, Bayesian inference,  and post-selection inference. His interdisciplinary research aims to promote the better use of statistics in biosciences, concussion research, and social-economic studies. He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Statistical Association (ASA), and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS). His recent honors and awards include the Founders Award (2021) from the ASA, the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award (2021) from the University of Michigan,  the Carver Medal (2022) from the IMS, and the Noether Distinguished Scholar Award (2025) from the ASA.
