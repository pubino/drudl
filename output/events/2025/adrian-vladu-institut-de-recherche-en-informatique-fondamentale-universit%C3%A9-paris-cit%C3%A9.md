Breaking the Barrier of Self-Concordant Barriers: Faster Interior Point Methods for M-Matrices

## Details

Event Description

**Abstract:** We study two fundamental problems in optimization: (1) scaling a symmetric positive definite matrix by a positive diagonal matrix so that the resulting matrix has row and column sums equal to 1, and (2) minimizing a quadratic function subject to hard non-negativity constraints. Both problems lend themselves to efficient algorithms based on interior point methods (IPMs). For general instances, standard self-concordance theory limits the iteration complexity of IPMs to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$, where $n$ is the matrix dimension. We show via an amortized analysis that, when the input matrix is an M-matrix, an IPM with adaptive step sizes solves both problems in only $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ iterations. As a corollary, using fast Laplacian solvers, we obtain an $\ell_{2}$ flow diffusion algorithm with depth $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ and work $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3}\cdot \mathrm{nnz})$. This marks a significant instance where a standard log-barrier IPM permits provably fewer than $O(n^{1/2})$ iterations.

**Bio:** Adrian Vladu is a permanent researcher at the CNRS, based in Paris at Université Paris Cité. His research covers a broad range of optimization problems, combining tools from convex geometry, continuous optimization, and linear algebra to design faster algorithms for both discrete and continuous settings. His recent work focuses on practical algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees, notably in the development of interior point methods (IPMs). He received his PhD in Mathematics from MIT, and subsequently held a postdoctoral position at Boston University.
