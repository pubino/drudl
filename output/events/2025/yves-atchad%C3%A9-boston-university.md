PDE parameter estimation using PINN

## Details

Event Description

**Abstract:** Understanding dynamical processes/systems by learning the coefficients of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental problem in theoretical and applied sciences. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently gained popularity for solving PDEs and estimating their parameters from noisy observations. However despite their empirical successes, the statistical properties of these estimators remain poorly understood. In particular, due to the complexity of neural networks and the non-parametric function estimation involved, PINNs often produce biased estimates of PDE parameters.  This talk describes some recent results that we have obtained on the topic, as well as a rigorous statistical framework (both frequentist and Bayesian) for drawing reliable inference on PDE parameters using PINNs.

Joint work with Yi Sun and Debarghya Mukherjee

**Bio:** Yves Atchade is Professor and a Duan Family Faculty Fellow at Boston University. He is an elected fellow of the Institute of Mathematical statistics, and associate editor of several leading statistical journals including the Harvard Data Science Review, the Bernoulli Journal, the Journal of the American Statistical Association. His current research interests deal mainly with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, the statistical properties of Bayesian procedures, and the development of statistical methods for improved rainfall and flood forecasting.
