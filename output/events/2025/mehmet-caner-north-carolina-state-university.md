#  Mehmet Caner, North Carolina State University 

Model Estimation Free, Dense and High Dimensional Consistent Precision Matrix Estimation

## Details

Event Description

**Abstract:** Precision matrix estimation is a cornerstone concept in statistics, economics, and finance. Despite advances in recent years, estimation methods that are simultaneously (i) dense, (ii) consistent, and (iii) model-free are lacking.  While each of these targets can be met separately, achieving them together is challenging. We address this gap by introducing a general class of estimators that unifies these features within a nonasymptotic framework, allowing for explicit characterization of the computational complexity. signal-to-noise ratio trade-off. Our analysis identifies three fundamental random quantities complexity, signal magnitude, and method bias that jointly determine estimation error. A particularly striking result is that ridgeless regression, a tuning-free special case within our class, exhibits the double descent phenomenon. This establishes the first formal precision matrix analogue to the well-known double descent behavior in linear regression. Our theoretical analysis is supported by a thorough empirical study of the SP 500 index, where we observe a doubly ascending Sharpe ratio pattern, which complements the double descent phenomenon.
