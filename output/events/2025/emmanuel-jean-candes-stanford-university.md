#  Emmanuel Jean Candes, Stanford University 

What Statistics and AI Oﬀer Each Other?

## Details

Event Description

**Abstract:** This talk will discuss how thinking carefully about AI inputs and outputs yields more powerful, safer AI. By examining several vignettes, we shall answer questions such as: How do we train language models under cost constraints? What happens when we’ve exhausted all available data? If I start a clinical trial using the drug AI thinks is best, will it pan out? How can we ensure high quality products when AI is used in a larger workflow? That is, how do I know whether AI automated a task correctly? AI powered predictions are beginning to substitute for real data when collection of the latter is difficult, slow, or costly. How then should we leverage machine learning predictions both as a substitute for high-quality data and as a tool for guiding real data collection?
